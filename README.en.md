# RIMES

[![中文](.github/readme/labels/zh.svg)](README.md) [![English](.github/readme/labels/en.svg)](README.en.md) [![日本語](.github/readme/labels/ja.svg)](README.ja.md) [![한국어](.github/readme/labels/ko.svg)](README.ko.md) [![Español](.github/readme/labels/es.svg)](README.es.md)

With respect for open source, the Chinese input logic of this project is based on the [RIME input method engine](https://rime.im/).
RIMES is an input method for more than one operating system. Three original slot-like surfaces carry what you want to do: 1. an explicit buffer before text is committed 2. Capsule, for clipboard history, screenshots, and a personal knowledge base 3. Mailbox, a conversation window for information that arrives from outside.

Schemes include full Pinyin, double Pinyin, Shengbi, Wubi, and English, plus the chorded input used in stenography and custom imports. For new users, the package **bundles** librime and the dictionaries and is ready to use.

> **RIMES** is the name of the project’s architecture. The public product names are **Lingxi IME** in English, **灵犀输入法** in Simplified Chinese, and **靈犀輸入法** in Traditional Chinese. These names are already used for the iOS App Store listing.

## What problem it solves

One input method covers everyday translation, generation, and polishing, without leaving the app you are in. The input method and its plug-ins do the work:

- **Buffer** (`⌘⇧B`): a text workbench before commit. Chinese or English enters the buffer first, where you can translate it live or generate and rewrite it with the selected AI connector. After you confirm, it is **explicitly delivered** into the current field.
- **Capsule** (`⌘⇧V`): a bar at the bottom of the screen. Text, links, images, files, and colors you just copied appear in Recent. What you want to keep goes into notes, images, PDFs, skills, or passwords.
- **Mailbox** (`⌘⇧M`): AI conversations, notes, and external items waiting for review stay in this window. You can start a conversation and choose a connector you have already configured.

## Notes on the main capabilities

> After installation and a graphical login, a one-shot background job uses `open -g` to start the same RIMES process, so the global shortcuts for Buffer, Clipboard History, Mailbox, and Capsule work across input methods.
>
> Before a release package replaces the system payload, it audits every ordinary local account. It fails immediately if it finds a same-ID development app or job other than the current GUI user's development install, which postinstall can retire, or if a home cannot be checked safely. Postinstall retires that development install, audits again, and only then updates the system job as a transaction that can be rolled back. The login guard only stops later if development traces appear. Neither job sets `KeepAlive`, and neither starts a second UI/IME service.
>
> Mailbox and Capsule are ordinary windows that take keyboard focus. Opening either from another input method, by shortcut or by a Mailbox notification, switches to RIMES first so the feature is complete. Closing it does not switch back, and a later switch you make yourself is left as you set it. The feature then falls back as described below.
>
> These features do not touch another input method's IMK client, and they do not read, commit, or cancel its composition. The only injected key is the optional single `⌘V` when Capsule activates (see the Capsule bar below). The Settings shortcut also works across input methods. Its Mailbox and Capsule pages show configuration and status only. Conversations and records stay in their own windows.

| Capability | Shortcut | Contents | Action | Storage | Limit |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Input schemes | — | Rime Ice full Pinyin, Natural Code, Xiaohe, Wubi 86, English | — | — | — |
| Buffer | `⌘⇧B` | Text before it is committed | Switch to RIMES, then capture and deliver in chunks | — | After you switch away, only the system clipboard is used, not IMK |
| Capsule bar | `⌘⇧V` | Recent copies; notes, images, PDFs, skills, passwords | Click to select, double-click or Return to paste. `⌘S` saves | This Mac only | Paste needs Accessibility; otherwise it only reaches the clipboard |
| Mailbox | `⌘⇧M` | AI conversations, notes, items waiting for review | New conversation; the first Return starts generation | The model is bound to that conversation | CLIs use their default model |
| Capsule manager | Gear or brush | Five kinds of items, with preview and copy | Four chords reveal a password, for at most 15 seconds | Optional iCloud; passwords and keys stay on this Mac | The passphrase is stored only as a local digest |
| Settings | `⌘⇧S` | Shortcuts, status, sync, and security | Opens only while RIMES is the current input method | — | Does not embed the Mailbox or Capsule windows |

Live translation, AI generation, and stream input are buffer plug-ins. Chording is a built-in extension. Versions and IDs are in the lists below.

| Name | Kind | Notes | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| Live translation | Buffer plug-in | Apple on-device translation, or AI | Enabled, macOS 15+ |
| AI generation | Buffer plug-in | Codex, Claude Code, or an OpenAI-compatible API. Plain / Markdown / JSON stays in Buffer until you commit it | Enabled |
| Stream input | Buffer plug-in | Pinyin or chords go to the selected AI, which returns at most 5 mutually exclusive guesses | Enabled; delivered only after you choose one |
| Chording | Built-in extension | Combined chords and left-then-right split strokes, plus custom keymaps | Disabled |

## Install

This release targets **1.1.0**: [macOS installer](https://github.com/scholay/rimes/releases/tag/v1.1.0), [Android APK](https://github.com/scholay/rimes/releases/tag/android-v1.1.0), and [Windows EXE](https://github.com/scholay/rimes/releases/tag/windows-v1.1.0). The macOS package is signed and notarized; Android uses the long-term signing key; the Windows EXE is unsigned. iOS offers approved test builds through the [public TestFlight invitation](https://testflight.apple.com/join/Kdj9RB4q); TestFlight shows the builds currently available to install. Linux stays on its existing version. Refer to each release page for current availability.

A user has reported host-app crashes on macOS 27 when switching to RIMES in the App Store sandboxed versions of WeChat and QQ after installation. If affected, switch to another input method and follow the [per-app input-source cache backup and recovery guide](docs/macos/input-source-cache-recovery.md#english). The installer does not clear other apps' caches; restarting the app or logging out is not a guaranteed fix. Investigation remains open in [#90](https://github.com/scholay/rimes/issues/90).

To build locally, clone the source and its pinned official plugins:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/scholay/rimes.git
cd rimes
```

## Automatic updates

An installed, formally signed copy of RIMES checks GitHub Releases for [`scholay/rimes`](https://github.com/scholay/rimes). Unsigned `vX.Y.Z-preview.N` builds are not on that channel.

The macOS automated release workflow uses the commands below. Platform-specific procedures are in [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md), and changes are in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md):

```bash
./scripts/release.sh --dry-run preview  # preview the plan, CI gates, and release notes
./scripts/release.sh preview            # unsigned macOS preview vX.Y.Z-preview.N
./scripts/release.sh stable             # promote the preview line to vX.Y.Z (requires Developer ID)
./scripts/release.sh platform minor     # explicit Windows/Linux data preview for maintenance (does not block macOS)
```

Every application release is published on `scholay/rimes`. macOS `vX.Y.Z` is a stable release. `vX.Y.Z-preview.N` is an unsigned pre-release and is not updated automatically. Android and Windows packages use `android-vX.Y.Z` and `windows-vX.Y.Z`, respectively. The legacy Windows/Linux data package `platform-preview-vX.Y.Z` is always a pre-release.

## Contributors

The full list is in [CONTRIBUTORS.md](CONTRIBUTORS.md).

The core maintainer is a consumer-product manager, not a programmer by training, and is grateful for the era of vibe coding.

**AI programming assistants**: Claude, Cursor, Codex, and Grok took part in design, implementation, and review.

## Known issues

- **Linux: quitting Fcitx5 before a deploy finishes can leave the process running for minutes.** A first-run or background librime deploy cannot be cancelled, and a larger dictionary makes the wait longer. See [#43](https://github.com/scholay/rimes/issues/43).
- **Linux: clicking another field immediately after dragging the Buffer toolbar can leave capture on.** Reproduced only in Firefox on X11, when the click lands in the same window within about 10 ms of release. Click again or press Esc to recover. See [#44](https://github.com/scholay/rimes/issues/44).
