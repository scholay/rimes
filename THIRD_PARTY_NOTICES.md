## Rime Ice configuration and dictionaries

The Rime schemas, dictionaries, Lua modules, OpenCC data, symbol tables, and
supporting files under `rime-data/` include material derived from
[`iDvel/rime-ice`](https://github.com/iDvel/rime-ice), distributed under the
GNU General Public License version 3 only. The original import is identified by
RIMES commit `d6d9f9cea97da478540b8a5e9a5c102216e2cf1d`; subsequent modifications
are available in this repository's history. The corresponding source is the
plain-text data shipped in this repository and in the preview packages.

The GPL text and a detailed source notice are included as
`rime-data/licenses/GPL-3.0.txt` and
`rime-data/licenses/rime-ice-SOURCE.md`.

The Xiaohe double-pinyin mapping and its mixed Chinese/English static table
are additionally pinned to upstream Rime Ice revision
`c398c0d4526b012cb3b306f792089abed13e0413`. The schema header and Rime Ice
source notice record the RIMES adaptation and exact checksums.

`rime-data/lua/search.lua` retains its embedded attribution to Mirtle and is
licensed separately under
[CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/); its source URL
is recorded both in the file header and the Rime Ice source notice.

## rime-easy-en dictionary

`rime-data/easy_en.dict.yaml` is imported from
[`BlindingDark/rime-easy-en`](https://github.com/BlindingDark/rime-easy-en) at
revision `54a4a07289412efc54134092c0d945f895a71ed3` and is distributed under
the GNU Lesser General Public License version 3. The license and source notice
are included under `rime-data/licenses/`.

## Rime Octagram language model

The Simplified-Chinese language model used by the hidden consciousness-stream
schema and its upstream `grammar.yaml` come from
[`lotem/rime-octagram-data`](https://github.com/lotem/rime-octagram-data),
pinned respectively to master revision
`8ceef1b42eb77e86501382a52e85c309c0f2f04c` and hans revision
`f8ce3b534733e489a8470a7c2adf5a154e8ea069`. They are distributed under
the GNU Lesser General Public License version 3. Exact asset size, checksum,
source boundary, and license location are recorded in
`rime-data/licenses/rime-octagram-data-SOURCE.md`.

## Rime Wubi 86

`rime-data/wubi86.schema.yaml` and `rime-data/wubi86.dict.yaml` are imported
from [`rime/rime-wubi`](https://github.com/rime/rime-wubi) at revision
`152a0d3f3efe40cae216d1e3b338242446848d07` and are distributed under the GNU
Lesser General Public License version 3. The dictionary is verbatim; RIMES
modifies the schema to use the already bundled Rime Ice dictionary for pinyin
reverse lookup and the bundled default punctuation preset. The exact source,
modification boundary, checksum, and license text are included as
`rime-data/licenses/rime-wubi-SOURCE.md` and
`rime-data/licenses/rime-wubi-LICENSE`.

## 呦呦音形 (麓鸣输入法 · 音形分支)

The 呦呦音形 chord schemes (`yoyo-yx` with 折梅 fingering, `yoyo-yx-hm` with
寒梅 fingering), their shared `yoyo.yaml`, dictionaries and `lua/yoyo/`
processors are by Rayalizing, from
[`Rayalizing/yoyo`](https://github.com/Rayalizing/yoyo) at revision
`2f9dcc86f04558282c185b7c712630a311b8513b`. They are macOS chord-extension data
and are excluded from the Linux and Windows preview packages. The upstream
repository declares no license; the file list, checksums, redistribution
status and upstream data provenance are recorded in
`rime-data/licenses/yoyo-SOURCE.md`.

RIMES-authored application and packaging code remains MIT-licensed. Those MIT
terms do not replace the licenses above for third-party data.

## AVL Drumkits — Black Pearl 4pc

The acoustic drum sample library `Black_Pearl_4_LV2.sf2` is by Glen MacArthur
and Robin Gareus, from x42/avldrums.lv2 commit
`9389f16f139410d9a55f9006976bd54cbd8b7806`. It is bundled unmodified, separately
from RIMES code, under CC BY-SA 3.0 with the author's exception for music and
other non-sample-library works. The full upstream attribution/exception is in
`Music/AVL-README.txt`, shipped with the sample asset.

Source: https://github.com/x42/avldrums.lv2/tree/9389f16f139410d9a55f9006976bd54cbd8b7806/sf2

License: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/

The x42 LV2 player/FluidSynth code is not included. AudioKit's AppleSampler
loads the licensed sample library. RIMES drum patterns are original; no
BeatBuddy recordings, MIDI content, or firmware are redistributed.
